How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Minus meant something was removed
    Plus meant someting was added

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easier to spot and correct mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that I know when I manually commit
    Cons are that I may forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Each file is separate because you're only modifying one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to find the commits, then use git diff to find differences
    between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always revert.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Practicing!
